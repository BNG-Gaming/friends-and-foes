Main goal of the Friends&Foes mod is to expand minecraft with all mobs which lost the votes.

The plan is to first add all of mobs listed below and then hopefully tweak them with some feedback from the community to get that vanilla minecraft feeling.
Even when i am not currently working on specific mob which is next in line waiting to be implemented.
I already got pretty solid ideas for most of the mobs.

Feel free to look over my code for examples of how i have implemented and solved various problems while writing this mod, incorporate snippets into your own.
You can also look into the [blockbench directory](blockbench) which contains all of the models and into the [textures directory](textures) for the textures and take some inspiration.
Get inspired, but please don't just copy & paste any of it as your own.
